This paper summarises and applies the Kramers-Moyal expansion and the theory of stochastic resonance to model complex deterministic systems. The Kramers-Moyal expansion is found to accurately model a range of deterministic systems: from a simple stochastic differential equation (SDE) to more complicated electrical circuits. We replicate results from the literature to confirm the methodâ€™s efficacy and apply it to a novel system, the Lang-Kobayashi Laser equations, and find evidence of interesting dynamical behaviour after a range of numerical simulations. A second method is tested with stochastic resonance to determine the determinstic dynamics of a Lorenz system is properly modelled as noise.
