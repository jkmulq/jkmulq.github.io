permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'This paper summarises and applies the Kramers-Moyal expansion and the theory of stochastic resonance to model complex deterministic systems. The Kramers-Moyal expansion is found to accurately model a range of deterministic systems: from a simple stochastic differential equation (SDE) to more complicated electrical circuits. This paper was written for a summer research internship with the Australian Insitute for Mathematical Sciences (AMSI), and was supervised by Dr. Thomas Stemler at the University of Western Australia.'
